# algorithmdb
The Aim of this project is to provide a collection of reusable Algorithms which can be used effectively in different scenarios.  Algorithm implementations are in Java. Objective here is to implement algorithms which should be more efficient than the JDK implementation and also to create a platform for the researchers who works on Data Mining, Encryption algorithms, ect.. to collaborate and contribute to this project.

# Features
Reusable codes
Tested the Algorithm implementations with different set of datas and provided the statistics in the header comment, so that developers can choose and reuse the algorithm which solve their business problem

This project is Migrated from sourceforge. It is 7 Year old project (https://sourceforge.net/projects/algorithmdb/)
